The show is noted for well-developed characters, originality, complex plots, religious themes and for starring the only black captain of all the Star Trek series to be featured as the show's protagonist. The series often showcased darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and (in later seasons) an emphasis on many aspects of war.","Orbiting the liberated planet of Bajor, a Federation space station guards the opening of a stable wormhole to the far side of the galaxy.",2369-2375,Rick Berman / Michael Piller (creators),Deep Space Nine station / Bajor,"California, USA",,,,,,,,

The first and second season were absolutely mesmerizing and compelling. The character development, the story, the plot twists; all amazing! Literally, pulled a few all-nighters because I had to know what happened next in the series. The premise of the show is after evacuating Earth do to global nuclear bombings and radiation, the International Space Station decide to send '100' of the stations adolescent deliquents down to earth so see if it is habitable again. Middle to end of season 3 start to get a little weird and supposedly it was supposed to end after season 3 so they attempt to wrap up the series. I have tried to continue watching but am no where as entranced as I was with seasons 1 and 2.","Set ninety-seven years after a nuclear war has destroyed civilization, when a spaceship housing humanity's lone survivors sends one hundred juvenile delinquents back to Earth, in hopes of possibly re-populating the planet.",2149,Jason Rothenberg (developer),Earth (post-apocalyptic) / The Ark space station,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",,,,,,,,

The look and feel is very TNG-era. Many episodes tackle modern day social issues like LGBTQ rights, social media and religion. The characters are interesting and relatable, since they talk and behave like real, imperfect people. Though the series has a comedic element, it doesn't interfere with the other messages, and we get a very good balance of sci-fi, humor, drama and moral. Highly recommended for (but not only) Trekkies.","Follows the crew of the not-so-functional exploratory ship in the Earth's interstellar fleet, 400 years in the future.",2417-2421,Seth MacFarlane (creator),USS Orville / Various planets,"California, USA",,,,,,,,
